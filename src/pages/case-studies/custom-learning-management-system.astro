      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>
        Crework runs live cohorts for aspiring Product Managers. As with every education initiative,
        they faced challenges with engagement and course completion rates.
      </p>
      <p>
        They wanted to provide their students with a better way to engage with the cohort content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Existing third-party learning management systems (LMS) lacked the customization needed to
        meet their specific learning approach and goals.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="space-y-3" id="solution">
      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>
        We developed a custom LMS software tailored to the company's unique needs. The platform
        empowers course managers and coordinators to create new cohorts, add students, schedule
        tasks, create assignments, and share resources. With this new LMS platform, the students
        gained streamlined access to all learning materials, including resources, assignments,
        recordings, and tasks through a dedicated interface.

      <h3>Data Driven Learning</h3>
      <p>
        Addressing the challenge of maintaining student engagement in online learning, our focus was
        on creating a highly customizable platform. The LMS's standout feature is its ability to
        tailor the learning experience to each cohort's specific needs. We meticulously designed an
        intuitive interface for both the cohort manager and students. This thoughtful approach
        simplifies the process of creating, assigning, and accessing learning materials, fostering a
        more engaging and effective learning environment.

    <div class="space-y-3" id="timeline">
      <h3>Timeline</h3>
      <p>
        At Crework Labs, we approach each project with a structured timeline to ensure efficiency
        and clarity. For this LMS project, we began with extensive user research and experience
        design, crucial for understanding the unique needs of both cohort managers and students. We
        then progressed to coordinated development of the cohort management and student interfaces,
        followed by rigorous testing and refinement based on user feedback. Overall, the MVP of the
        LMS took 1 month to build and iterations took another 1 month.

      <h3>Powerful yet Intuitive</h3>
      <p>
        The LMS presents a clean, user-friendly design that belies its powerful capabilities. We
        crafted specific modules for cohort creation, resource management, and performance tracking,
        complemented by an equally intuitive student interface for accessing resources and
        submitting assignments.
