<!-- # What Features Should Your MVP Include -->

<!-- A Simple Feature Prioritization Guide for Founders

If you are building your first MVP, the biggest challenge is deciding what to include and what to exclude. Too many founders build ten features when they only needed two. Others build features users never asked for. Some delay launch for months only to discover the core value was already enough.

This guide will help you decide exactly what features your MVP should include using simple frameworks, real examples, and a clear step by step method. -->

Most founders struggle not with building but with scoping. The real challenge is deciding what your MVP should include and what it should avoid. An MVP exists to validate one core problem for one type of user. That is all.

You can also explore a deeper comparison in our guide on [**MVP vs Prototype**](/blog/mvp-vs-prototype-simple-explanation-key-differences-examples-2025-guide) here.

## Why MVP Feature Prioritization Matters

Your earliest users do not care about how many features your product has. They care about one thing.

- Does this product solve my problem?

- Feature prioritization ensures that you

- Focus on the main user problem
- Build only what supports the core action
- Launch faster
- Spend less
- Collect feedback earlier

Good scoping is the single biggest advantage an early stage founder can have.

If you are not fully sure about the problem you want to solve, read our guide on **how to validate your startup idea before building** here.

---

### 1. Identify the Primary User Problem

Your MVP must solve one clear problem. A product that tries to solve three problems solves none.

**Ask yourself:**

- What is the single outcome my user wants?
- What pain point is the most intense?
- What is the simplest functional solution?

This becomes the foundation of your MVP requirements.

---

### 2. Define the One Core Action

Every successful MVP has one core action.

**For example:**

- Ride hailing core action is booking a ride
- Food delivery core action is placing an order
- Design tool core action is creating a design
- Task app core action is adding a task

Every feature exists to support this one action. Nothing else matters at this stage.

You can explore how teams plan these actions with [**product roadmaps** here](https://www.productplan.com/roadmap/).

---

### 3. List Every Possible Feature

Do a raw idea dump. Do not filter yet.

- Login
- Payments
- Search
- Filters
- Notifications
- AI automation
- Dashboard
- Analytics
- Profile
- Chat
- Listings
- Integrations
- Admin controls

This list will shrink drastically in the next step.

---

### 4. Use a Simple Prioritization Framework

Here are the easiest frameworks founders can use.

### The MoSCoW Method

- Must Have
- Should Have
- Could Have
- Will Not Have for now

Only the Must Have items go into your MVP.

### The Value and Effort Matrix

- High value and low effort features enter the MVP.
- High value and high effort features come later.
- Low value features rarely matter.

### The Problem Action Outcome Method

For every feature ask
Does this feature directly enable the core action

If the answer is no, it is not an MVP feature.

---

### 5. Create Your MVP Feature List

Your final MVP should only have three categories of features.

#### One

- Foundation Features
- These allow the product to function at a basic level.
- Login
- Core task capability
- Basic database storage

#### Two

- Value Features
- These deliver the primary outcome for the user.
- Upload text for an AI writing tool
- Search for a ride
- Create a habit
- Generate a response

#### Three

- Minimum Support Features
- These build user trust and provide clarity.
- Simple onboarding
- Basic navigation
- Clear error messages

Everything else goes into your backlog for future versions.

# What Not to Include in an MVP

- Avoid anything that slows down validation.
- Complex reporting
- Multiple user roles
- Advanced design systems
- Deep analytics
- Gamification
- Full onboarding flows
- Extensive integrations
- Personalization engines
- Custom automation

These do not help your first hundred users. They delay learning and increase cost.

---

## Signs You Scoped Your MVP Correctly

- Users complete the core action without confusion
- You can measure real behavior
- You launch within weeks
- Your product delivers value early
- You can collect insights to shape version two

This is exactly how founders validate ideas, as shared in the [**Y Combinator startup library** here.](https://www.ycombinator.com/library)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many features should an MVP have

Most MVPs have between three and eight total features depending on the product.

### Should an MVP include design polish

No. Clean and simple design is enough. Pixel perfect work is not required for v one.

### Can an MVP be built with no code

Yes. Many successful MVPs begin with no code tools because the goal is validation, not engineering perfection.

### Should an MVP include an admin panel

Only if it is essential for the product to function. Many founders use simple spreadsheets or manual workflows instead.

## Conclusion

Your MVP does not need to be big. It needs to be clear. Identify the core problem. Choose the core action. Prioritize value over complexity. Build only what is required to deliver the outcome.

This is how founders launch faster, reduce cost, and validate ideas with real users in weeks.
