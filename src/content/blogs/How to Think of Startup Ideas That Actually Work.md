# **How to Come Up With Startup Ideas in 2025: A Practical Guide for Builders**

Most people who want to build something face the same mental roadblock.

"I don't have an idea."

It feels like everything good has already been built.

Every market feels crowded.

Every problem feels solved.

But the truth is simpler than it seems.

Good ideas do not appear out of nowhere. They are discovered, observed, or borrowed from patterns you learn to notice.

By the end of this guide, you may not magically have a billion dollar idea.

But you will understand where founders look, what questions they ask, and how they find ideas that are both buildable and valuable.

Let us begin.

---

## **1. Start With Questions, Not Ideas**

The strongest founders are not the ones who sit and brainstorm.

They are the ones who notice problems before others do.

Ask simple questions every day.

Why are people choosing this product

Why are they behaving this way

What is frustrating them right now

What tasks are too slow, too expensive, or too complicated

### **Observe quietly**

Watch people in real settings.

- at home
- at work
- in supermarkets
- on public transport
- in restaurants

Most startup ideas come from spotting small inefficiencies in normal life.

### **Example scenario**

Imagine you are a 25 year old software engineer in NYC.

Your daily routine alone is full of idea triggers.

- rent management
- roommate coordination
- meal planning
- commute issues
- dating
- budgeting
- gym consistency
- loneliness
- remote work fatigue

Every single one of these is a problem someone has solved, but never perfectly.

Write everything down.

Ideas do not come from genius. They come from awareness.

---

## **2. Find Global Ideas and Localize Them**

Here is a secret almost every successful founder knows.

Most billion dollar companies are adapted versions of ideas that worked somewhere else.

**Examples:**

- Amazon inspired Alibaba in China
- eBay inspired Alando in Germany
- DoorDash inspired Zomato in India

These are not copies.

They are localized solutions built for regions with different culture, pricing, behavior, or infrastructure.

### **Where to find proven ideas**

- YC Startup Directory
- Product Hunt
- Indie Hackers
- Top US and EU startup lists
- Crunchbase
- TechCrunch announcements

Your job is simple.

Identify what is working somewhere else.

Adapt it to your own region.

Add your own improvement.

This approach works far more often than trying to invent something completely original.

---

## **3. Fix Something Broken**

Some of the best startup ideas hide in industries people hate dealing with.

- insurance
- legal paperwork
- healthcare
- real estate
- logistics
- government services
- education

These industries move slowly, remain outdated, and frustrate customers.

If something has been broken for a long time and people still complain about it, there is a business waiting to be built.

**Look for:**

- unnecessary fees
- long waiting times
- poor interfaces
- lack of transparency
- manual workflows
- no modern alternatives

Fixing something that frustrates you is one of the most reliable ways to generate startup ideas.

## **4. Ride a Technology Wave**

Timing matters more than brilliance.

Netflix worked only when internet speeds improved.

Fitbit worked only when Bluetooth syncing became effortless.

AR apps took off only when smartphones became powerful enough.

Right now the biggest wave is Generative AI.

New products are emerging every day.

- AI agents
- AI customer support
- AI dashboards
- Vision based models
- Workflow automation
- Niche AI copilots
- AI tools for specific professions

### **Where to explore**

**Subreddits:**

- r startups
- r sideproject
- r entrepreneur
- r MachineLearning

**Tech communities:**

- Hacker News
- Lobsters
- realtech subreddit

You do not need to create cutting edge AI.

Sometimes a simple AI tool for a tiny niche turns into a million dollar business.

---

## **5. Improve Something That Already Works**

People overvalue novelty and undervalue execution.

Some of the most successful companies did not invent their categories.

Henry Ford did not create the first car. He made it scalable.

Mark Zuckerberg did not create the first social network. He made it addictive.

Jeff Bezos did not create the first online bookstore. He made it frictionless.

Your job is not to invent something magical.

Your job is to find something that already works and make it significantly better.

### **A quick exercise**

Pick three businesses you admire.

Write down:

- what they do well
- what they do poorly
- what you would improve
- what customers constantly complain about

This simple exercise can spark twenty or more strong startup ideas.

### **Learn from people who ship fast**

Follow builders who publicly share their process.

- Pieter Levels
- Dagobert Renouf
- Marc Lou

Indie hackers are a goldmine for understanding what people actually want and what they will pay for.

## **6. Read "How to Get Startup Ideas" by Paul Graham**

This is one of the most important essays for anyone who wants to build.

Not because it gives you ideas, but because it teaches you how to think like a founder.

**His core message:**

The best startup ideas are found by people solving their own problems.

This mindset alone changes how you see the world.

---

## **Final Thoughts**

You do not need a groundbreaking, world changing idea today.

You need one problem, one frustration, or one inefficiency and the courage to build something around it.

If you ever feel stuck, remember this truth.

Ideas matter far less than execution.

Start anywhere.

Just start.
