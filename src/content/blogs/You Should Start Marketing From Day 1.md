Every founder is biased toward their own idea.

Almost all fall into the same trap: “I'll build such an amazing product/ecosystem/company that people will flock to it on their own.”

But that’s far from reality, mainly because no one cares unless you tell them to.

And the breakdown that follows is nothing short of this:

A simple way to avoid this consequence—before launch and even before you have a solid idea—is to start marketing. Market your product, or at the very least, market _yourself_, so that when you launch, you have people ready to listen.

But marketing, to most people outside the domain, seems like running ads or hiring celebrities. Sounds simple, right? Just hire someone, throw some money, and wait for the magic.

The truth? It’s _really_ not like that.

Maybe 0.01% of companies create something so unique or solve a problem so perfectly that they grow organically with little to no marketing.

Thinking your idea is one of them? That’s wishful thinking. Not impossible, but you need to stay grounded.

There are three types of tasks when building a company: **priority tasks**, **important tasks**, and **unimportant tasks**.

Marketing? It falls into the “important” category. It might not seem like a priority in the early stages, but trust me—it’s something you _have_ to start from day one.

Now, how do you market when you don’t have time or money?

Here’s a simple 3-step guide to get things rolling for your startup:

1. **Before marketing, market _yourself_ and _Build in Public_**

   When you don’t have a product yet, what you do have is _you_. Social media is everywhere. Pick a platform you’re comfortable with—LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, or even a WhatsApp group—and start talking about what you're building.

   There’s a movement called "building in public." The idea is simple: as people around you, including your second-degree connections, hear about your journey, you might gain some early traction. You might even find someone interested in helping! Plus, when it’s time to launch, people are more likely to trust you because they’ve followed your wins (and losses) along the way. They feel connected to your story and are more inclined to support or buy from you.

2. **Find your tribe**

   The internet is _full_ of people just like you, working on similar or even the same thing. It’s easy to feel like you’re alone in your journey, but trust me—they’re out there. You just need to find them.

   Why is this important? Because when people know who you are and what you’re building, they’re more likely to support you when you launch. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn are great for connecting with other business owners. Be active, join the right groups (just a search away!), and don’t forget to explore Reddit and Discord communities where your peers hang out.

3. **Join communities where your users are**

   This is where Reddit and Discord shine. Figure out where your potential customers gather. There are specific groups on LinkedIn, Reddit, and other platforms where people discuss the problems you’re solving. If you’re a yoga instructor, for example, search for relevant subreddits or groups. Join, see what others are talking about, contribute to the conversation, and subtly mention how you’re solving that problem.

At the end of the day, hiring people or running ads comes later. Start by building your personal brand—talk about what you’re doing and provide value for free if you can. Engage with communities, listen, and be part of the conversation.

_Marketing starts with you. Share your story, and the brand will follow._
