# What Features Should Your MVP Include

A Simple Feature Prioritization Guide for Founders

If you are building your first MVP, the biggest challenge is deciding what to include and what to exclude. Too many founders build ten features when they only needed two. Others build features users never asked for. Some delay launch for months only to discover the core value was already enough.

This guide will help you decide exactly what features your MVP should include using simple frameworks, real examples, and a clear step by step method.

---

## Why MVP Feature Prioritization Matters

Your earliest users are not judging you on how many features you have. They care about one thing:

**Does this product solve my problem in a simple and reliable way?**

This means:

- Focus on the problem
- Identify the essential actions
- Build the minimum required to deliver value

Everything else can wait.

---

## Step One

Identify the Primary User Problem

Your MVP must solve a single clear problem. Not three problems. Not ten use cases. Just one.

**Ask:**

- What is the main outcome my user wants?
- What is the single most painful blocker they face?
- What is the simplest way to help them achieve the outcome?

This forms the core of your feature list.

---

## Step Two

Define the One Core Action

Every successful MVP has one core action.

**For example:**

- Ride hailing core action is booking a ride
- Food delivery core action is placing an order
- Design tool core action is creating a design
- Task app core action is adding a task

Everything else supports this moment.

---

## Step Three

List All Possible Features

Write down all potential features without judging them. This is a brain dump stage.

**Examples:**

- User login
- Payment integration
- Profile settings
- Notifications
- Admin dashboard
- Analytics
- AI automation
- Search
- Filters
- Listings
- Chat

You will not build all of these. You will trim them down aggressively.

---

## Step Four

Use a Simple Prioritization Framework

Here are three easy methods founders can use.

### The MoSCoW Method

- **Must Have** — Only these go into your MVP
- **Should Have** — For version two
- **Could Have** — Nice to have later
- **Will Not Have for now** — Out of scope

Only the Must Have items go into your MVP.

### The Value versus Effort Matrix

- High value and low effort features are MVP features
- High value and high effort features are for version two
- Low value features do not make sense at all

### The Problem Action Outcome Method

Ask for each feature:

**Does this feature directly enable the core action?**

If no, remove it from MVP scope.

---

## Step Five

Create Your MVP Feature List

After prioritizing, your MVP feature list should include only three categories.

### Number One

Foundation Features

These are required for the product to work.

**Examples:**

- Login
- Core task function
- Basic data storage

### Number Two

Value Features

These are the features that deliver the core outcome for the user.

**Examples:**

- Upload resume for an AI resume tool
- Search for a ride in a mobility app
- Create a habit in a habit tracking app

### Number Three

Minimum Support Features

These are essential to user trust.

**Examples:**

- Basic error messages
- Basic onboarding
- Simple navigation

That is it.

Three categories only.

Everything else belongs in your product backlog.

## Examples of MVP Feature Lists

### Example One: Social Audio App

**Foundation features:**

- Email login
- Profile

**Value features:**

- Record audio
- Play audio

**Support features:**

- Simple share option

### Example Two: AI Writing Tool

**Foundation features:**

- Account system

**Value features:**

- Input form
- AI text generation
- Output screen

**Support features:**

- Save text

### Example Three: Marketplace App

**Foundation:**

- User login

**Value:**

- Create listing
- Browse listings
- Purchase option

**Support:**

- Basic chat or contact button

These examples show that MVPs are always smaller than founders expect.

---

## What Not to Include in Your MVP

**Do not include:**

- Complex analytics
- Full design system
- Gamification
- Multiple user roles
- Integrations with many external platforms
- Advanced AI models
- Personalization features
- Full onboarding sequences

These add complexity but do not contribute to early validation.

---

## Signs You Chose the Right MVP Features

- Your users can perform the primary action without confusion
- You can measure user behavior
- You can launch in weeks
- Your early users get value
- You can collect real feedback

If these are true, you have scoped your MVP correctly.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many features should an MVP have

Most MVPs have between three and eight total features depending on the product.

### Should an MVP include design polish

No. Clean and simple design is enough. Pixel perfect work is not required for v one.

### Can an MVP be built with no code

Yes. Many successful MVPs begin with no code tools because the goal is validation, not engineering perfection.

### Should an MVP include an admin panel

Only if it is essential for the product to function. Many founders use simple spreadsheets or manual workflows instead.

---

## Conclusion

Your MVP does not need to be big. It needs to be clear. Identify the core problem. Choose the core action. Prioritize value over complexity. Build only what is required to deliver the outcome.

This is how founders launch faster, reduce cost, and validate ideas with real users in weeks.
