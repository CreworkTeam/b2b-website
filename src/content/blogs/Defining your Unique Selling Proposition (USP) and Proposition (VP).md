Every builder’s nightmare is thinking, _"Why would someone buy what I'm building?"_

It's hard, but it's important to face.

That’s where two key concepts come into play that people often mix up: your **Unique Selling Proposition (USP)** and your **Value Proposition (VP).**

## **Let’s start with the Unique Selling Proposition (USP)**

Your USP is what sets your product or service apart from the competition. It’s about the unique features or benefits that make you different—and better. Essentially, it answers the question: **“Why should I buy from you rather than someone else?”**

**Some well-known USP examples:**

- **Apple**: Sleek, innovative products with seamless integration across devices.
- **Uber**: We’re changing the way the world moves.

## **Now for the Value Proposition (VP)**

A value proposition takes it a step further. It’s a short statement that explains why someone should choose your product or service, not just based on features, but the overall experience or outcome it delivers. It’s answering: **“What’s in it for me?”** or **“How will this product improve my life?”**

**Examples of VPs from brands you know:**

- **Apple**: Empowering people through cutting-edge, beautifully designed technology.
- **Uber**: The easiest, smartest way to get around.

## **The Key Difference**

- A **USP** is all about what makes your product unique.
- A **VP** focuses on the overall value it offers to your customers.

In simple terms, a USP is **product-focused**, while a VP is **customer-focused**.
