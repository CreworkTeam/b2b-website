At its core, for anyone who wants to build, it often comes down to this: 'I don't have an idea.'

**Seems like everything good has already been done. So, how do you find the next big idea that's both doable and something people really want, or at least solves a problem for someone?**

Sure, you can say “I’ll build a better version of OpenAI”. There's no problem with aiming high, but it's a huge goal—especially if you're not already an expert in that field.

And if you were, then you probably wouldn't be here. You get it.

By the time you finish reading this, will you have a billion-dollar idea? Probably not.

But you'll definitely get some direction on where to start. Plus, there is some homework to help you kickstart your Builder’s journey.

Remember, the only important thing is to **build, no matter how small it is**.

Let’s get started 💪🏼

## 1. Begin by asking questions ❓❔❓

Fundamental to building your core as a creator is curiosity. Trust that this simple quality will aid in generating ideas.

- Ask questions. Though they may seem trivial, they delve into the essence of human behavior.
- Observe people at home, work, shopping, dining out. Do so with intent: _Why did they come here? Why are they ordering this? Why are they watching that?_ Simply observe without engaging in conversation.
- Read material beyond your comfort zone and delve into challenging subjects.

Know that there are several problems around you right now.

For example; let’s assume you’re a 25-year-old male working as a Software Engineer in Gurugram.

Consider the community you belong to, your daily routine for work, and for pleasure. _Is there something you feel could be improved or if it were available, could help you? Look around and examine the issues you face._

Just write them down.

What can you make **cheaper**, **faster**, or **better**?

What problems are your friends and peers facing?

Find one person to help.

So you see the problem for an avid reader → Tired of seeing the same old ‘Atomic Habits’, ‘Harry Potter’ and thus wants → to find underrated book to read.

## 2. Expand Horizons but Serve Locally 🌎

One common way to find something to build is by discovering great and proven ideas in overseas markets and bringing them to your local region.

You might already know this, but let's just put it out there:

If we take a look at some successful Indian startups, they aren’t necessarily groundbreaking or entirely new concepts compared to what's in the west.

- Flipkart/ Snapdeal → Amazon
- Oyo → Airbnb
- Ola → Uber
- Zomato → Yelp
- BookMyShow → Fandango
- MakeMyTrip → Expedia
- Zoho → Salesforce
- Razorpay → Stripe

But then, you also have companies like Postman, Stack Overflow that have truly innovated and made us proud.

The point is that the best builders keep a close eye on global innovation. Who knows an ideas if brought to life may solve something for people in your region.

## **3. Fix What's Broken** 🔧

Ever heard of turning lemons into lemonade? Well, you can do something similar by fixing industries that are "broken." These are the ones with a bad reputation and haven't bothered to change because they've had a monopoly for ages.

In India, we've got a cool story about Ditto Insurance. We all know how when we hear of insurance in India, it's very normal to believe that it's a scam or someone's trying to deprive you of money. But this is where Ditto Insurance saw their opportunity. They're disrupting the insurance market by becoming a trustworthy option in an industry filled with deception.

It's like being a superhero, fixing what's wrong in the world of business! All you got to do is figure out what bugs people the most, and then work your magic.

💡 To give an example: 
In Crework’s Builder’s cohort 4, an AI tool: <a href="https://beta.sifthq.app" target="_blank">Sift</a> was designed to assist organizations and recruiters in filtering job applications based on the scores assigned to resumes. 
These scores are determined by the candidate's work experience and achievements.

Recruiting can be challenging, with numerous applicants making it difficult to filter through. That's where this tool will come in handy for recruiters.

## **4. Catch the Tech Wave** 📺

Let's chat tech—but first, a tip: Keep an eye out for those big changes happening in technology.

Think about it: Sometimes, awesome ideas don't take off because they're way too ahead of their time. So, when you're playing with tech, watch for those big shifts and grab the opportunities they bring.

Take Netflix, for example. It only became super popular when internet speeds got fast enough for watching HD videos to be easy. And Fitbit? It became a hit when Bluetooth made syncing with your phone super simple. And those AR apps? They only got big when everyone had a phone that could handle them.

Oh, and speaking of grabbing such golden chances, have you heard about Gen AI? There are lots of cool new startups and products popping up all over the place.

So, what are you waiting for? Dive into those communities, see what people are building, and join in the fun. Check out some cool subreddits too—you'll find some real gems there!

## 5. Question Yourself, "How Can I Make This Better?” 🤔

**Novelty doesn’t make money, doing better than your competitor does!**

What often stops people who want to start a business is the idea that their idea has to be completely original.

"I want to solve a problem no one else has solved."

**Yeah, come down from your high horse, buddy.**

> Henry Ford didn't invent the first car.
>
> _Mark Zuckerberg didn't create the first social network._
>
> _Jeff Bezos didn't start the first online bookstore._

What they all did well was notice something that was already working and found ways to make it even better.

Here's something you can do right now —

**Make a list of businesses you admire and write down one to three ways you could improve them.**

Don't worry about how realistic they seem at first.

Just get those creative juices flowing!
