<!-- # **MVP Cost in 2025: Real Pricing, Examples and What Founders Should Stop Overpaying For** -->

## **Introduction**

Ask five agencies "How much does an MVP cost?" and you will get five completely different answers. [Here’s a simple breakdown of What an MVP is](/blog/mvp-vs-prototype-simple-explanation-key-differences-examples-2025-guide).

Some will quote 10000 dollars.  
Some will quote 100,000 dollars.  
Some will answer with the classic "it depends."

Here is the truth most founders never hear:

**MVP cost is determined by product complexity, not by the number of screens or features.**

This article breaks down:

- the real factors behind MVP pricing
- how we price MVPs at **Crework Labs**
- what founders should stop paying for
- real examples and timelines from builds we have delivered

If you are an early-stage founder, this is the most transparent breakdown you will find online.

# **1. What Actually Determines MVP Cost**

Forget vague agency language. These are the real levers that increase or decrease the cost of your MVP.

### **1. The Core User Journey**

A simple, linear user flow is inexpensive.

More screens, more user roles and branching experiences increase development time.

### **2. Backend Complexity**

This is the biggest cost driver in any MVP build.

If your product needs:

- user authentication
- dashboards
- an admin panel
- API integrations
- automation workflows
- a scalable backend

The cost rises accordingly.

### **3. Data Workflows**

Data storage, processing, transformation and analytics all add engineering effort.

### **4. Design Requirements**

Custom UI takes significantly longer than minimal template-driven design.  
Most early-stage founders do not need fully custom design at MVP stage.

### **5. AI or ML Components**

Any AI-driven features like:

- computer vision
- NLP
- image generation
- embeddings
- agent workflows

increase both engineering time and testing cycles.

# **2. The Three MVP Pricing Tiers Explained**

At **Crework Labs**, we use a simple and transparent pricing model.  
It makes decision-making easier for first-time founders.

### **Tier One: Validation MVP**

**100 dollars to 3,000 dollars**

Ideal for founders who want to validate a concept before building a full product.

Examples:
- landing page
- clickable Figma prototype
- no-code MVP
- automation-based workflow

### **Tier Two: Standard MVP**

**3,000 dollars to 7,000 dollars**

The most common category for early-stage founders.

Typically includes:

- web app
- login system
- user dashboard
- two to four core features
- admin panel
- analytics

This is enough to acquire initial users and test product-market fit.

### **Tier Three: Advanced or AI MVP**

**7,000 dollars to 15,000 dollars**

Best suited for founders building:

- AI-driven platforms
- marketplace flows
- multi-role systems
- complex automation
- real-time dashboards
- tools with multiple third-party integrations

These require deeper engineering and testing.

# **3. Real Examples from Crework Labs**

These examples help founders understand real-world timelines and cost.

### **Coliving MVP built in three weeks**

Features:

- rent tracking
- ticketing
- events
- reward points

Cost level: mid tier  
Outcome: onboarded 50 users within the first two weeks.

### **AI Retail Vision MVP**

Goal: detect customer demographic → trigger relevant ad recommendations.

Engineering tasks:

- live camera feed handling
- lightweight vision model
- ad recommendation engine
- operations dashboard

Cost level: high tier  
Outcome: validated with three retail stores.

### **Startup Community Platform**

Features:

- onboarding
- posting and commenting
- events
- mentorship bookings
- admin panel

Cost level: mid to high  
Outcome: internal pilot launched successfully.

# **4. Hidden MVP Costs Founders Forget to Budget For**

These are often overlooked but important:

- email infrastructure (SES, SendGrid)
- notifications
- server and hosting
- database scaling
- analytics
- post-launch bug fixes
- security basics

Individually small but collectively meaningful.

---

# **5. How Founders Can Avoid Overpaying for Their MVP**

### **1. Eliminate unnecessary features**

Feature creep is the biggest cost multiplier.

### **2. Work with teams who understand early-stage validation**

Traditional dev shops build everything.  
Startup-centric teams reduce scope.

### **3. Demand a one-page feature map**

If the team cannot outline your MVP clearly on a single page, that is a warning sign.

### **4. Use two or three week development sprints**

Avoid long, unstructured three-month cycles with no visible progress.

---

# **6. How Crework Labs Prices MVPs**

We price based on:

- clarity of scope
- backend complexity
- engineering depth
- how close you want to get to launch

We do not price based on:

- number of screens
- billable hours
- inflated agency estimates

Founders should pay for outcomes, not hours.
