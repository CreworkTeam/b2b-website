## How to Validate Your Startup Idea Before Spending Money

Most founders fail before they launch.

Not because of bad execution.

Because they build something nobody asked for.

Validation is not optional. It is survival.

This guide shows how to validate before spending serious money.

---

### Step 1 Define the Core Problem

Write one sentence.

Who is the user

What painful problem do they have

Why current solutions are insufficient

If this is unclear, do not build yet.

### Step 2 Talk to 20 Real Users

Do not pitch.

Ask about:

Their workflow

Their pain points

Current solutions

What they pay for

Look for repeated patterns.

### Step 3 Test With a Landing Page

Create a simple page explaining:

The problem

Your solution

Clear benefit

Call to action

Track signups.

If nobody signs up, investigate before building.


### Step 4 Collect Pre Commitments

Strong validation signals:

Pre orders

Deposits

Beta waitlists

Letters of intent

Interest without commitment is weak validation.

### Step 5 Build a Prototype Before an MVP

Use simple design mockups.

Test flows.

Test messaging.

Test usability.

Only then move to MVP.

### Step 6 Launch a Small MVP

Start with minimal features.

Track:

Activation

Retention

Engagement

Real user behavior is the strongest signal.
