## Problem Statement

Startups often face challenges when raising funds, including:

**1. Inefficient Investor Outreach:** Manually identifying, contacting, and managing investor interactions.

**2. Data Sourcing Hassles:** Lack of reliable and centralized investor data.

**3. Tracking and Follow-Up Difficulties:** Difficulty in monitoring email engagement and managing follow-ups.

**4. Scattered Information:** No streamlined way to share and track key documents like pitch decks and financials.

**3. Simple CRM:**
A drag-and-drop interface to manage investor engagement stages like "Intro," "Follow-Up," and "Committed."

**4. Master Inbox:**
Easily manage investor communications with quick filters for sorting, a central view of replies, and detailed message threads for efficient follow-ups.

**5. Analytics:**
A centralized dashboard to track the performance of your campaigns. Monitor key metrics such as how many investors viewed your pitch deck, how many responded, and other engagement insights to optimize your outreach strategy.
