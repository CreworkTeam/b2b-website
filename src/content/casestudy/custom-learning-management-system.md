## Problem

Crework runs live cohorts for aspiring Product Managers. As with every education initiative, they faced challenges with engagement and course completion rates. They wanted to provide their students with a better way to engage with the cohort content. Existing third-party learning management systems (LMS) lacked the customization needed to meet their specific learning approach and goals.

## Solution

We developed a custom LMS software tailored to the company's unique needs. The platform empowers course
managers and coordinators to create new cohorts, add students, schedule tasks, create assignments,
and share resources. With this new LMS platform, the students gained streamlined access to all
learning materials, including resources, assignments, recordings, and tasks through a dedicated
interface.

## Data

Driven Learning Addressing the challenge of maintaining student engagement in online learning, our
focus was on creating a highly customizable platform. The LMS's standout feature is its ability to
tailor the learning experience to each cohort's specific needs. We meticulously designed an
intuitive interface for both the cohort manager and students. This thoughtful approach simplifies
the process of creating, assigning, and accessing learning materials, fostering a more engaging and
effective learning environment.

## Timeline At Crework

Labs, we approach each project with a structured timeline to ensure efficiency and clarity. For this
LMS project, we began with extensive user research and experience design, crucial for understanding
the unique needs of both cohort managers and students. We then progressed to coordinated development
of the cohort management and student interfaces, followed by rigorous testing and refinement based
on user feedback. Overall, the MVP of the LMS took 1 month to build and iterations took another 1
month.

## Powerful yet Intuitive

The LMS presents a clean, user-friendly design that belies its powerful capabilities. We crafted specific modules for cohort
creation, resource management, and performance tracking, complemented by an equally intuitive
student interface for accessing resources and submitting assignments.
