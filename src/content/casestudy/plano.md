## Challenge

Parents often struggle to find the right extracurricular activities for their children. Information is scattered across websites, outdated directories, or hard-to-navigate local listings. PlanO wanted to solve this by creating a centralized marketplace that helps parents in Seattle easily discover, compare, and book activities such as swimming, dance, chess, robotics, and more.

The challenge was to build a platform that felt curated and personal, offered a map-first exploration experience similar to Airbnb, and allowed activity providers to onboard themselves without any manual effort or time spent entering data.

## Solution

We designed and developed a user-friendly web platform that brings together personalized recommendations, a highly interactive discovery experience, and automated provider onboarding. The solution revolves around three core systems: personalized onboarding, an interactive activity map, and a custom scraper engine that powers listing automation.

## Key Features

### Personalized User Onboarding

The onboarding flow asks parents for the child’s age, interests, and other basic preferences. Based on these inputs, we created a custom recommendation logic that surfaces the most relevant classes and camps. This ensures the platform feels tailored to each family rather than overwhelming or generic.

### Interactive Airbnb-Style Activity Map

Exploring activities becomes intuitive through a dynamic scrollable map. Parents can visually explore nearby options, filter based on age, timing, or category, and quickly tap into individual listings. The map and the listing cards update in real time, giving users a smooth, modern browsing experience similar to using Airbnb for travel.

### Automated Provider Onboarding With a Custom Scraper Engine

One of PlanO’s biggest opportunities was to remove friction for activity providers. Instead of asking them to manually upload schedules, pricing, descriptions, and images, we built an in-house scraping engine. Providers only need to submit their website URL. The scraper extracts structured data, formats it, and creates a draft listing automatically. It can also refresh listings periodically, ensuring information stays current with no operational overhead.

### Dual Experience for Parents and Providers

Parents can browse, explore the map, view detailed listings, save options, and book activities through a simple and intuitive interface.

Providers receive their own flow to oversee their listings, update information, and track visibility after their data has been scraped and imported.

## Design Philosophy

The interface blends a modern, friendly feel with a simple navigation structure. Since the target audience is busy parents, the design emphasizes clarity, easy scanning, and minimal friction. The product is built mobile-first to ensure that discovery and booking can happen on the go.

## Project Outcomes

The final MVP offers a complete marketplace experience with personalized recommendations, interactive discovery, and automated listing creation. Parents can now find activities for their children much faster and with more confidence. Providers can onboard themselves by submitting a single link. PlanO is now positioned as a scalable, modern solution that simplifies the process of discovering and booking children’s activities in Seattle.
