## Challenge

Early-stage founders frequently struggle with refining their pitch decks, often receiving vague, conflicting, or unstructured feedback. Investors have limited time to provide in-depth reviews, and while peers and mentors offer input, it may not always align with what truly resonates in fundraising scenarios. Founders needed a structured, data-driven solution to evaluate and enhance their pitch decks effectively.

## Solution

We developed an AI-powered pitch deck review tool, an intuitive, data-driven platform that analyzes pitch decks against top-performing presentations. The tool offers structured feedback, a scoring system, and actionable insights to help founders craft investor-ready decks. The AI evaluates decks based on industry best practices and investor expectations, offering a clear pathway to improvement.
