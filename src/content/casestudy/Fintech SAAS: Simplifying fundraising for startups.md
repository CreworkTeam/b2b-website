## Challenge

Startups often face challenges when raising funds, including:

1. Inefficient Investor Outreach: Manually identifying, contacting, and managing investor interactions.

2. Data Sourcing Hassles: Lack of reliable and centralized investor data.

3. Tracking and Follow-Up Difficulties: Difficulty in monitoring email engagement and managing follow-ups.

4. Scattered Information: No streamlined way to share and track key documents like pitch decks and financials.

4. Master Inbox:  
Easily manage investor communications with quick filters for sorting, a central view of replies, and detailed message threads for efficient follow-ups.
